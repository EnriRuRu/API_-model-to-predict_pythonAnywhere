# API_python_anywhere
This project consists of the use of a model to predict the variation in sales that would cause the investment in TV, newspaper and radio advertisements.

I generate a .py file with different endpoints to be able to predict the data that a user enters. Another endpoint to insert new data in the Database. 
Another endpoint to retrain the model using the newly inserted data as well.

Finally the APP is deployed in PythonAnywhere
